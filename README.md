# Revamping a website

## Town & Campus Hair Care inc. ##

I built this project to gain experience with improving a website that is already built.

I hoped to improve this website by:

* Making the layout and navigation more usable
* Making it Responsive/Mobile-friendly
* Making social media and coupons more visible
* Optimize resources for speed
* And of course, making it pretty
